# deep_learning_with_satellite_imagery_and_geospatial_data

Deep learning is growing and finding many unexpected applications. Earth observation and geospatial data is one of these fields where Deep Learning has made major inroads.
This course provides an introduction to Deep Learning applied to geospatial and remotely sensed data. Currently there are three exercices available:

- temperature prediction and introduction to DNN
- introduction to image classification and CNN using CIFAR 10
- introduction to semantic classification with remotely sensed data
